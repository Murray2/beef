	<h3> Procedure: </h3>

	<p class="red">*Safety Warning: DO NOT add any liquids to hot oil or they could explode. Also, never carry your hot oil around the kitchen. Wait until it cools down and then store it, don't pour it.</p>

	<p>This appetizer is a deconstructed Alberta Beef and potatoes, with two of my favorite sauces: glace and ponzu. I have used Alberta AAA Beef Tenderloin for this (but you can use any steak) and some veal bones to make the glace. To make the glace there is a stock recipe in the specifications folder (on the Culinary Arts Website). Reduce your stock until it has thickened and coats the back of a spoon when you stir it. Glace is not essential for this recipe if you can not get bones, but it adds a lot of flavour and umami.</p>

	<div class="center">

	</div>

	<p>I start by cooking the beef in a sous vide machine (you can just sear it in a pan if you do not have a sous vide machine or immersion circulator), until it is medium rare. Set the sous vide machine temperature to 56.5 degrees celsius for 1 hour. If you are going to pan fry it, wait until the searing part of the recipe, and sear it on all sides.</p>
	
	<div class="center">

	<p>Julienne 1 large onion and fry in olive oil with star anise. After the onion starts to soften, turn the heat to low. Slice garlic cloves into pieces the width of a potato chip (or a little thinner).</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/cook-1.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>The milk technique for the garlic is taken from Tomas Kellar's, "The French Laundry" cookbook. He cooks the garlic in milk 3 times. I find poaching it once is adequate for this recipe. Make sure it is strained off and dried well before the next step.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/deep-temps.png" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>You can see in this reference from Modernist Cuisine, the temperature of your oil is very important in making chips. I like to keep my temperature around 160 degrees celsius (320 fahrenheit). </p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/oil-temp.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>If you do not have a thermometer you will have to use one piece of garlic to test the oil, and see how quickly it browns. Once your oil is at the right temperature the process will go fairly quickly.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/fry-galic.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p> As the garlic chips come out of the oil, put them on an absorbent towel and salt them while they are still hot.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/fried-garlic.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>
	<p>Spagetify the potato with a spiralizer mandoline. If you don't have one, just grate the potato into long strips.</p>
	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/mandoline-potato.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>
	<p>Drop your potato into the hot oil. A smaller pot or pan works best so you do not have to use so much oil.</p>
	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/fry-potato.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>
	<p>I just use old chop sticks to turn it over.</p>
	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/flip.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>Again, season the potato net as soon as it is cooked. The net can also be used for a main course, but in this appetizer, we will break it into pieces that will sit on top of our beef.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/fry-season.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>At this point our onions are almost cooked. As they are drying out, add a bit of sugar to make them crispier and some aged balsamic vinegar to add to the depth of the sweetness of the caramel.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/carmalize-onions.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>Add some beef glace to enhance the beef flavour. According to Heston Blumenthal in "The Fat Duck Cookbook": together, star anise and caramelized onions create a new compound that enhances the flavour of meat. So this combination of ingredients is all about umami. Add a tsp on butter at the end.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/glace-balmasic.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>At this point the gelatin from the glace has reduced and coated the onions, making a preparation that will flavour the beef greatly. Season the onions.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/onion-sugar.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>Remove the beef from the sous vide machine and cut it into nice 1-2 inch cubes. You do not want them so big that they are more than one bite or this appetizer will get messy. Season with salt and sear the meat hard on one side. Let it rest for a minute. Slice some green onions on a bias as you wait.</p>
	
	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/dice.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>Time to assemble: place the meat down first on the plate, then add the caramelized onions on top of the meat. Put the potato net on top of the caramelized onion, with a small slice of spring onion and a garlic chip on top.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/assemble.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>The combination of different onions and root vegetables work really well together. It gives the beef a nice combination of earthy flavours. The word "crispy" sells better than any other word on menus, this dish is both crispy and it melts in your mouth.</p>

	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/finish-1.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>The last touch is to add yet even more umami. To eat this, put some ponzu on a spoon and set the appetizer in the ponzu sauce on the spoon. The citrus soya sauce (ponzu) adds the saltiness and sourness to counteract the sweet onions. If you get it right, this dish will be balanced perfectly.</p>

	<p> <strong>ENJOY!!!</strong></p>

	<p>Note: you can make your own ponzu sauce, but it is hard to get yuzu lemons. Qzina in edmonton sells a frozen yuzu juice, but it is expensive and hard to get right now. Some people use a mixture of citrus fruit to try to emulate the flavours, you can look a recipe up online. If you love ponzu like me, you could keep a small yuzu tree in your house. For now, just buy some at the grocery store, it is right beside the kikoman soya sauce.</p>
